How are arguments passed – by reference of by value?
The short answer is “neither”, actually it is called “call by object” or “call by sharing”. In Python everything is an object and all variables hold references to objects. The values of these references are to the functions. As result you can not change the value of the reference but you can modify the object if it is mutable. Remember numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, list and dicts are mutable.

Do you know what list and dict comprehensions are? Can you give an example?
List/Dict comprehensions are syntax constructions to ease the creation of a list/dict based on existing iterable. list comprehensions are generally faster than normal loops 
#Normal loop
a = []
for x in range(10):
    a.append(x*2)
# a == [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

 
# list comprehension
a = [x*2 for x in range(10)]


What is PEP 8?
PEP 8 is a coding convention(a set of recommendations) how to write your Python code in order to make it more readable and useful for those after you. 

Do you use virtual environments?
I personally and most(by my observation) of the Python developers find the virtual environment tool extremely useful. Yeah, probably you can live without it but this will make the work and support of multiple projects that requires different package versions a living hell.

Do you know what is the difference between lists and tuples? Can you give me an example for their usage?
list are mutable while tuples are not.
tuples can be hashed e.g. to be used as keys for dictionaries. As an example of their usage, tuples are used when the order of the elements in the sequence matters e.g. a geographic coordinates

Do you know the difference between range and xrange?
Range returns a list while xrange returns a generator xrange object which takes the same memory no matter of the range size.
In the first case you have all items already generated(this can take a lot of time and memory) while in the second you get the elements one by one e.g. only one element is generated and available per iteration. 

Tell me a few differences between Python 2.x and 3.x
Some are: In Python 3.x are: all strings are now Unicode, print is now function not a statement. There is no range, it has been replaced by xrange which is removed. All classes are new style and the division of integers now returns float.

What are decorators and what is their usage?
“Decorators allow you to inject or modify code in functions or classes”. In other words decorators allow you to wrap a function or class method call and execute some code before or after the execution of the original code.
Usage examples include – logging the calls to specific method, checking for permission(s), checking and/or modifying the arguments passed to the method etc.

The with statement and its usage.
In a few words the with statement allows you to executed code before and/or after a specific set of operations. For example if you open a file for reading and parsing no matter what happens during the parsing you want to be sure that at the end the file is closed. This is normally achieved using the try… finally construction but the with statement simplifies it usin the so called “context management protocol”.
